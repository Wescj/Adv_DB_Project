1. Finalizing a House Sale
   
When finalizing a house sale contract, the system must atomically link multiple entities (such as the buyer, the property, the sales agent, the third-party escrow agent, etc.). This involves creating a record in the sale table that documents the buyer's escrow deposit, financing method, contract signing date, and other details. This process must constitute a complete transaction unit. If any step fails (e.g., invalid buyer ID or property already sold), the entire sale record creation must roll back to prevent incomplete or invalid contract data.
3. Submitting a Set of Decorator Choices

The process where a buyer selects a series of decorative upgrade options during a specific construction phase constitutes a transaction. For example, on a “Decorator Choices” form, a buyer might simultaneously select multiple items for exterior finishes, plumbing, electrical work, and interior design. When the buyer or designer submits this form, all these selections (corresponding to multiple records in the decorator_choice table) must be successfully saved as a single unit. If any single option fails to save due to invalidity (e.g., missing price or incorrect option ID), the entire batch of selections should be rolled back. This prevents partial recording of customer choices, which could lead to construction errors.

5. Creating a Complete House Style

When a builder introduces an entirely new house style (e.g., “Renaissance”), this operation involves more than simply adding a record to the housestyle table. A complete, marketable house style must include at least one basic elevation design and detailed room layout information (rooms). Therefore, the sequence of operations—inserting relevant records into the housestyle, elevation, and rooms tables—must be treated as a single transaction. If the main house style record is created successfully but its required elevation or room information fails to create, the style remains incomplete. This results in data inconsistency and renders the style unavailable for customer use.
